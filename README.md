Hey everyone it's your brudda Tunji!

I won't make this too long so let's get to the point. This is my first ever project coding with the Go langauge. It's a simple CLI based booking app that has all different types of data types involved as well as user input validation that makes sure people aren't entering incorrect data. Honestly I love how simple it is and I look forward to using Go for my networking and Cybersecurity.

Please let me know if the code has any errors I need to fix.
